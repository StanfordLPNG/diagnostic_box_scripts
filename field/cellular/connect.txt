1) open a terminal session with either the modem or pcui serial interface

2) enter pin code as usual: AT+CPIN=xxxx

3) connect using: AT^NDISDUP=1,1,"yourapn"
(I believe the first number is the CGDCONT - this may require an
 existing entry, or overwrite anything already there)

4) Retrieve IP addresses using: AT^DHCP?
Note that this has side effects: Packets will not flow until this
command is sent

5) configure the interface manuall with the output of the previous command:
^DHCP:4d92124d,fcffffff,4e92124d,4e92124d,470d5c1,c60f4382,100000000,50000000

$ perl -e 'print join(",",map { join(".", unpack("C4", pack("L", hex))) } split /,/, shift),"\n"' 4d92124d,fcffffff,4e92124d,4e92124d,470d5c1,c60f4382
